# Assignment - Clean Architecture âœ¨

This is an assignment where I've made an application with Clean Architecture. 

It's a very simple application featuring only two models - book & author with full endpoint CRUD. 
The essence of the app lies in it's architecture, security and clean code. 

Featuring: 

- Github Actions
- Branch protection rules
- Test Coverage (NUnit & FCC)
- CQRS with MediatR
- According to SOLID with Clean Code
- JWT Token Authentication
